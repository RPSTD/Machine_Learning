## Discussion about 

- While loop
     - while // condition//:
        - //excution code//

- Function: When making the function in python, use "def" keyword
    - def function_name():
        - function content
- array: we can simply build a array by using numpy library
    - a= np.array([3,5,3,6,7,8])
- we can access those data like this.
     - a[5]
     - a[2:3] // Here it mention the array indexes between values. 
     - a[:6] // here it mention is print values from 0 to 6
     - a[3:]
- create 4x4 array
    - new_array = np.array[[1,3,4,5],[3,8,5,5],[4,8,7,6],[4,9,7,8]]
- These are some common methods can use to access array values
    - print(array[1,1:]) // here mention is print 1 row and 1 to last column values to before values.(that means the last column values are not include in the output)
    - print(array[:,2:3]) // here also, print all row values that combine with 2 column values
- caluculating sum, mean and min terms
    - sahan = np.array([3,6,8,9,8,7,5,7,8,9,7,6,5,4,3,2,3,5,7,8])
    - sahan.sum()
    - sahan.min()
    - sahan.mean()
- Matrix multification
    - addition, subtraction and multification from scaler values are very simple. normal rules will be apply to those. 
    - but considering matrix multification, 
        - p*q is we say "Hadamart product"
    - real multification of matrix is partially difference.
        - p.dot(q)
