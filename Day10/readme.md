### Machine Learning Algorithm

## Linear Regrassion.

- Linear regression is perhaps one of the most well known and well understood algorithms in statistics and machine learning. 
- Linear regression is a linear model, eg: a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input veriable (x) and the single output variable (y). 
- More specially, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variable(x).
- When there is a single input variable(x), the method is referred to as Simple Linear Regression. When there are multiple input variables, literature from statistics often refers to the method as Multiple Linear Regression.
- Different techniques can be used to prepare or train the linear regrassion equation from data, the most common of which is called Oridinary Leasy Squares. 
- It is common to therefore refer to a model prepared this way as Ordinary Least Squares Linear Regression or just Least Squares Regression
